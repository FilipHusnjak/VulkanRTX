# Transparent and Reflective Surfaces Rendering Using Vulkan and Hardware Accelerated Ray Tracing

### Bachelor of Science Thesis at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, under the mentorship of prof. dr. sc. Željka Mihajlović.

### Abstract
This thesis explores raytracing algorithm and gives several examples of real world applications.
It explains which optimisations and data structures are required for real time raytracing and how Nvidia RTX platform uses specialized hardware to achieve impressive results.
Paper gives a brief introduction to modern graphics API Vulkan and introduces different concepts and global illumination models typically used by raytracers.
The raytracer is implemented using already mentioned graphics API Vulkan and Nvidia RTX platform.
As part of the implementation, several examples of light reflections, refractions and rough surface reflections using described algorithms are presented and compared to the real light behavior.
